    <p>American sprinter and long jumper Tori Bowie – a three-time Olympic medalist and a two-time world champion in track and field – has died, according to her agent, Kimberly Holland. Bowie was 32 years old.

        “We’re devasted [sic] to share the very sad news that Tori Bowie has passed away,” an Instagram post from Bowie’s representation and Holland’s company, Icon Management Inc., said.
        
        “We’ve lost a client, dear friend, daughter and sister. Tori was a champion…a beacon of light that shined so bright! We’re truly heartbroken and our prayers are with the family, friends and everyone that loved her.”

    <p>A native of Sandhill, Mississippi, Bowie was a three-time All-American at the University of Southern Mississippi.

        Bowie’s last official competition was June 2022. Her last appearance on the world stage was in 2019 at the world championships in Doha, when she finished fourth in the long jump.
        
        In a statement to CNN, World Athletics (WA) said: “[Bowie] was a rare athletic talent who represented the United States in both sprints and jumps during her decorated career.
        
        “A triple Olympic medallist in Rio in 2016, she reached the pinnacle of our sport when she won two gold medals, in the 100m and 4x100m relay, at the world championships in London a year later. We send heartfelt condolences to her family, friends and the USA track and field community at this difficult time.”</p>
